# RealmJS
Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables. This repository holds the source code for Realm's JavaScript bindings for integrating with mobile apps built using ReactNative and PhoneGap.

## Setup
This repository uses submodules so you need to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the realm-js root directory before running any examples or including the project in your app.

## ReactNative Example
Make sure your environment is set up to run react native applications. Follow the instructions here https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html.

The ReactNative exampoe project is in the `examples/ReactExample` directory. You need to run `npm install` in this directory before running the example for the first time.

## ReactNative Project Setup
- Create a new ReactNative project `react-native init <project-name>` and open the generated XCode project.
- Drag `RealmJS.xcodeproj` into the `Libraries` folder in your project.
- In the target for your application, add `libRealmReact.a` in the `Link Binary with Library` build phase.
- Use Realm in your app.
- Drag `RealmJS.framework` from the `Products` directory under `RealmJS.xcodeproj` into the `Embedded Libraries` section in the `General` tab for you app's target settings. This bundles the library with your app.

## Documentation
Currently there is no documentation for the ReactNative apis. You can see examples of how to use the apis in the example app and in the js test files here: https://github.com/realm/realm-js/tree/master/tests
