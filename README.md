![Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/raw/master/logo.png)

Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for Realm's JavaScript bindings for integrating with mobile apps built using React Native and Apache Cordova (PhoneGap).

Currently Realm only supports React Native, but will expand to other Javascript solutions soon.  

## Features

* **Mobile-first:** Realm is the first database built from the ground up to run directly inside phones, tablets and wearables.
* **Simple:** Data is directly [exposed as objects](https://realm.io/docs/react-native/latest/#models) and [queryable by code](https://realm.io/docs/react-native/latest/#queries), removing the need for ORM's riddled with performance & maintenance issues.
* **Modern:** Realm supports relationships, generics,and  vectorization.
* **Fast:** Realm is faster than even raw SQLite on common operations, while maintaining an extremely rich feature set.
